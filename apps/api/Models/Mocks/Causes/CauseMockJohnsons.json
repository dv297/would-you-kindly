  "story": "Hi, we’re the Johnson family—my husband David, our kids Sophie (8) and Lucas (5), and me, Jennifer. Lately, we’ve hit a rough patch. David lost his job a few months ago, and while I’m working part-time as a nurse, it’s been hard to keep up with bills and everything the kids need.\n\nSophie loves school and reading, and Lucas is excited to start kindergarten, but they both need new backpacks, school supplies, and shoes. We’re also running low on basics like toiletries and non-perishable food.",
