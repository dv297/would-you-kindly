  "bio": "Hi, I’m Sarah, a single mom to Emily (12), Jake (9), and Mia (4). This past year has been really tough since I lost my full-time job, and while I’ve been working part-time, it’s still hard to provide everything we need.\n\nEmily’s starting middle school and needs warm clothes and winter gear. Jake is excited for school too but needs supplies like notebooks and art materials. Little Mia is starting preschool, but we can’t afford a backpack or shoes for her right now.\n\nWe’re also running low on basic household items and food. Any help with clothing, school supplies, or essentials would mean the world to us!",
